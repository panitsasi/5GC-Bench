# 5GC-Bench
5GC-Bench is a modular benchmarking framework for the 5G Core (5GC) designed to stress-test control and user plane VNFs under both synthetic and realistic workloads. It provides a unified toolchain for generating control-plane signaling, replaying user-plane traffic traces, and monitoring fine-grained VNF resource consumption in real time.
